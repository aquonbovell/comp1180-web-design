        <dt>Promotion</dt>
        <dd>Dancs Designs will take both a traditional approach to promotion/placement of our product (newspaper,radio
            and television advertisements) as well as a more modern approach (through social media platforms and a
            website). A part of the promotion will be the nature of our product itself, our superior and spectacular
            product will have customers discussing the services they received in a positive light, thereby attracting
            more customers.</dd>
