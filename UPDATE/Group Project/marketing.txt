        <dd>Dancs Designs will take both a traditional approach to promotion/placement of our product (newspaper,radio
            and television advertisements) as well as a more modern approach (through social media platforms and a
            website). A part of the promotion will be the nature of our product itself, our superior and spectacular
            product will have customers discussing the services they received in a positive light, thereby attracting
            more customers.</dd>

        <dd>The products Dancs Designs will be offering are our artistic skills that will help to style/augment the
            appearance of the building as well as sourcing the materials(furniture etc) that will be used for this
            purpose. Our products would satiate consumers' demand for an unconventional style of interior designing.
