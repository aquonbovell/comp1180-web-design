                <h2>What is Climate Change?</h2>
                <p>Climate change is the long-term changing of a location's temperature and usual weather patterns.
                    Climate change can relate to a specific place or the entire world. Weather patterns may become less
                    predictable as a result of climate change. Because projected temperature and rainfall levels can no
                    longer be depended on, these unexpected weather patterns might make it challenging to sustain and
                    develop crops in farming regions. Climate change has also been linked to more frequent and powerful
                    hurricanes, floods, downpours, and winter storms.Climate change is the long-term changing of a
                    location's temperature and usual weather patterns.</p>

                <h2>Why is Climate Change a Serious Problem?</h2>
                <img src="images/why-climate-change-a-problem.jpg" class="two" alt="">
                <p> People all across the world are seeing personally how climate change may devastate the earth.
                    Average temperatures that are steadily rising
                    feed increasingly catastrophic wildfires, storms, and other calamities that are becoming hard to
                    ignore. And, even while the globe is in
                    the grip of a devastating pandemic, experts are warning that climate change is still the greatest
                    threat to human health in recorded
                    history. Even as wildfires raged across the United States, Europe, and Siberia in August, World
                    Health Organization Director-General Tedros
                    Adhanom Ghebreyesus stated in a statement that "the hazards presented by climate change might
                    surpass those caused by any one illness."

                <h2>Who is Most responsible?</h2>
                <img src="images/who-is-responsible.jpg" class="three" alt="">
                <p>One of the biggest fights at the United Nations climate summit in Glasgow is whether — and how — the
                    world’s wealthiest nations, which are
                    disproportionately responsible for global warming to date, should compensate poorer
                    nations for the
                    damages caused by rising temperatures.
                    Rich countries, including the United States, Canada, Japan and much of western Europe, account for
                    just 12 percent of the global population
                    today but are responsible for 50 percent of all the planet-warming greenhouse gases released from
                    fossil fuels and industry over the past
                    170 years. Over that period, the Earth's temperature has risen by around 1.1 degrees Celsius (2
                    degrees Fahrenheit), generating more
                    powerful and deadly heat waves, floods, droughts, and wildfires. Poorer, more vulnerable countries
                    have requested richer countries to
                    contribute more funds to assist them adapt to these threats.</p>
            </div>

            <div>
                <h2>Where is it happening?</h2>
                <p>The current warming trend is undeniably the result of human activity since the mid-twentieth century,
                    and it is happening at an unparalleled
                    rate spanning millennia. Human activity has indisputably warmed the atmosphere, oceans, and land, as
                    well as causing vast and rapid changes
                    in the atmosphere, ocean, cryosphere, and biosphere. Satellites and other technology developments
                    have allowed scientists to glimpse the
                    overall picture of global climate change. Carbon dioxide and other gases were shown to trap heat in
                    the mid-nineteenth century. Many NASA
                    equipment fly because of their potential to influence the transmission of infrared energy through
                    the atmosphere. There is no doubt that
                    higher quantities of greenhouse gases will cause the Earth to warm.

            <div>
                <h2>When Will Climate Change Be Unavoidable?</h2>
                <p><img src="images/when-climate.jpg" class="four" alt="">Humans have already caused considerable
                    climate change, and we have set additional changes in motion.
                    If we stopped producing greenhouse
                    gases today, global temperatures would begin to level off within a few years. Temperatures would
                    thereafter plateau but remain much
                    above sea level for millennia. The time lag between what we do and when we experience it is less
                    than a decade.
                    While the effects of human actions on the Earth's climate to date are irreversible in the timeframe
                    of humans alive now, every tiny
                    amount of avoided future temperature rises results in less warming that would otherwise persist
                    perpetually.
                    According to the most recent predictions, global temperature would rise by 2.5 °C to 4.5 °C (4.5 °F
                    to 8 °F) by 2100 unless significant
                    action is taken to cut emissions. However, it may not be too late to avoid or mitigate some of the
                    worst consequences of climate
                    change. Climate change will necessitate a two-tiered response:
                    "Mitigation" refers to limiting the flow of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. "Adaptation"
                    refers to learning to live with and
                    adapt to climate change that has already begun.
                    The crucial question is how much carbon dioxide and other pollutants we will emit in the coming
                    years.

                    Our energy specialists assist with businesses to examine their energy consumption in order to reduce
                    their energy bills. This necessitates a
                    study of prior energy bills in order to identify how much energy is consumed, where and when it is
                    consumed, and how much it costs. Following
                    this, we work with clients to develop an energy plan that includes methods for lowering energy
                    usage,
                    avoiding energy waste, and offsetting
                    energy expenses, such as recommending that they purchase and install our energy-efficient appliances
                    and
                    machinery, energy-efficient windows
                    and lights, and replacing business automobiles with hybrid vehicles, all of which are outfitted to
