      <h2>Service</h2>
      <p>DANCS Design is an online interior design business made to be accessible to the residents of Barbados. We
        help you source high quality residential and commercial materials to create the room of your dreams. We
        offer a wide variety of products ranging from couch pillows and decorative paintings/pictures, desks,
        and plants. The aim is to provide high quality products whilst also keeping up with new trends in
        interior design. The products will be stored in a warehouse in Barbados, delivered to consumers and will
        host materials from both the Caribbean and internationally.</p>
      <h2>Target Market</h2>
      <p>Situated in Barbados, DANCS Design will be mainly for individuals and companies, specifically residential
        and commercial customers. Our business is both for new residents and businesses, or for those that are
        looking to change the look and feel of their building.</p>
      <h2>Is DANCS Designs Necessary?</h2>
      <p>There is a need for interior designers with an artistic eye and a typical approach to styling the
        interior of buildings. DANCS Designs will provide this. Individuals will revel in our high quality and
        creative approach to sprucing up their building of choice.</p>
      <h2>Our Company is Special for This Reason</h2>
      <p>Besides providing a suite of products from well known locations in the United States or England. DANCS
        Design also imports high quality items from foreign language speaking countries. Many of these countries
        have different cultures, thus they produce an abundance of distinct and unique designs that could go
        straight into your home or business depending on the type of atmosphere you are trying to achieve. </p>
      <h2>Management Team</h2>
      <p>The company, DANCS Designs, was founded by the team Hi-tech. Its members consist of our team leader Aquon
        Bovell and its other members Catherine Manning, Nakeada Trotman, Dominic Ward and Stephanie Harris. They
        were all taught entrepreneurship by the illustrious Mr. Clinton Gittens.</p>

      <h2>Product Feasibility</h2>
      <p>The Google Trends website ranks searches from a range of 0 - 100, from least popular to highest
        respectively. In the months September to October 2021 there was a noticeable spike in the searches for
        interior design. The popularity number for the searches was 97.</p>
      <h2>Industry/Target Market Feasibility</h2>
      <p>The company is centered around design, specifically interior design, and imports high quality designs
        from regional or international countries. Its main demographic are the many individuals who were located
        in St. Michael, St. James and Christ Church from the Google Trends search above. These customers are
        mainly going to require a fresh change to their living or work environment, or are in a new building
        space that needs re/furbishing.</p>

    <div id="Industry">
      <h2>Industry Analysis</h2>
      <p>Our business can be said to fall under the fragmented industries category since there are multiple
        interior design businesses in Barbados and there is no one company that holds a monopoly. It is a
        realistic place for our business to enter due to the lack of interior design businesses in Barbados that
        offer as high a quality or as high a level of unconventionality as we do. Though the interior design
        industry can be said to be a slow-growth industry, there is a meaningful difference between our products
        and our competitors.</p>

    <h2>Business Model</h2>
    <p>Our business falls under the standard business model; specifically, the traditional retailer business model
      as
      we are a business where its products are made by others and will be sold to consumers at a markup from the
      original price. Which also explains why this model best suits the company as the traditional retailer
      business
      model is a business model calling for a firm to sell its products or services, made by others, directly to
      consumers at a markup from the original price. Can be sold online or offline. (<cite>Barringer Bruce R;
        Ireland
        R Duane; Entrepreneurship - Fifth Edition</cite>) To further
      explain why this model best suits us, we can be compared to the online retail clothing and shoe brand
      Zappos,which provides products from companies like Leviâ€™s and Adidas. Alike DANCS Designs, Zappos also falls
      under the category of the traditional retailer business model as their products are made by others and sold
      directly to the consumer.</p>
