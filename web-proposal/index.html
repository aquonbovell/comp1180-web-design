				<h3>Our Company is Special for This Reason</h3>
				<p>
					Aside from offering a portfolio of items from well-known sites in the United States or England. We also import high-quality commodities from foreign-language-speaking nations. Because many of these nations have various traditions, they offer an abundance of distinct and original designs that might go immediately into your house or company depending on the sort of environment you are aiming to achieve.

			<h2>Feasibility</h2>
			<article class="container">
				<h3>Product/Service Feasibility</h3>
				<p>
					The Google Trends website evaluates queries on a scale of 0 to 100, from least popular to most popular. There was a substantial increase in searches for interior design from September to October 2021. The searches had a popularity rating of 97. 
				</p>
			</article>

			<article class="container">
				<h3>Industry/Target Market Feasibility</h3>
				<p>
					The company's focus is on design, primarily interior design, and it imports high-quality designs from regional and worldwide countries. Its key demography is the large number of people who were located in St. Michael, St. James, and Christ Church according to the Google Trends search above. These consumers will mostly demand a fresh change in their living or working environment, or they will be in a new building area that requires refurbishment.

		<section class="business-model">
			<h2>Business Model</h2>
			<article class="container">
				<p>
					Our company follows the normal business model, especially the traditional retailer business model, because our items are created by others and sold to customers at a markup from the original price. This also explains why this model is best suited to the corporation, as the typical retailer business model calls for a firm to offer its items or services, created by others, directly to customers at a markup from the original price. Can be sold both online and offline. 
					(<cite> Bruce R; Ireland R Duane; Entrepreneurship - Fifth Edition </cite>)
					To explain why this paradigm is better for us. We can be likened to the online retail apparel and shoe firm Zappos, which sells items from Levi's and Adidas. Zappos, like DANCS Designs, falls under the typical retailer business model.

		<section class="industry-analysis">
			<h2>Industry Analysis</h2>
			<article class="container">
				<p>
					Because there are several interior design enterprises in Barbados and no single company maintains a monopoly, our business may be classified as a fragmented industry. It is a viable market for our company to explore because there are few interior design firms in Barbados that provide the same degree of quality or uniqueness that we do. Despite the fact that the interior design sector is reluctant to expand, there is a significant distinction between our products and those of our rivals.
