            DANCS Design is an online interior design business made to be
            accessible to the residents of Barbados. We help you source high
            quality residential and commercial materials to create the room of
            your dreams. We offer a wide variety of products ranging from
            couch pillows and decorative paintings/pictures, desks, and
            plants. The aim is to provide high quality products while keeping
            up with new trends in interior design. The products will be stored
            in a warehouse in Barbados, delivered to consumers and will host

          <h4>Our Company is Special for This Reason</h4>
          <p>
            Besides providing a suite of products from well known locations in
            the United States or England. We also import high quality items
            from foreign language speaking countries. Many of these countries
            have different cultures, thus they produce an abundance of
            distinct and unique designs that could go straight into your home
            or business depending on the type of atmosphere you are trying to
            achieve.

            The Google Trends website ranks searches from a range of 0 to 100,
            from least popular to highest respectively. In the months
            September to October 2021 there was a noticeable spike in the
            searches for interior design. The popularity number for the
            searches was 97.

          <h3>Industry/Target Market Feasibility</h3>
          <p>
            The company is centered around design, specifically interior
            design, and imports high quality designs from regional or
            international countries. Its main demographic are the many
            individuals who were located in St. Michael, St. James and Christ
            Church from the Google Trends search above. These customers are
            mainly going to require a fresh change to their living or work
            environment, or are in a new building space that needs
            re/furbishing.

        <h2>Business Model</h2>
        <p>
          <img class="business-model-img" loading="lazy" src="images/slidebean.jpg" /> Our
          business falls under the standard business model; specifically, the
          traditional retailer business model as we are a business where its
          products are made by others and will be sold to consumers at a
          markup from the original price. Which also explains why this model
          best suits the company as the traditional retailer business model is
          a business model calling for a firm to sell its products or
          services, made by others, directly to consumers at a markup from the
          original price. Can be sold online or offline. (<cite>Barringer Bruce R; Ireland R Duane; Entrepreneurship -
            Fifth
            Edition</cite>) To further explain why this model best suits us. We can be
          compared to the online retail clothing and shoe brand Zappos,which
          provides products from companies like Levi&rsquo;s and Adidas. Alike
          DANCS Designs, Zappos also falls under the category of the
          traditional retailer business model.

        <h2>Industry Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          <img class="industry-analysis-img" src="images/scott-graham.jpg" />
          Our business can be said to fall under the fragmented industries
          category since there are multiple interior design businesses in
          Barbados and there is no one company that holds a monopoly. It is a
          realistic place for our business to enter due to the lack of
          interior design businesses in Barbados that offer as high a quality
          or as high a level of unconventionality as we do. Though the
          interior design industry can be said to be a slow-growth industry,
          there is a meaningful difference between our products and our
          competitors.
