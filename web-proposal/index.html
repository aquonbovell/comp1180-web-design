					Besides providing a suite of products from well known locations in the United States or England. We also
					import high quality items from foreign language speaking countries. Many of these countries have different
					cultures, thus they produce an abundance of distinct and unique designs that could go straight into your home
					or business depending on the type of atmosphere you are trying to achieve.

			<div class="container">
				<h3>Management Team</h3>

					and its other members Catherine Manning, Nakeada Trotman, Dominic Ward and Stephanie Harris. They were all
					taught entrepreneurship by the illustrious Mr. Clinton Gittens.

				<h3>Product/Service Feasibility</h3>
				<img class="product-industry-img" src="images/product-school.jpg" alt="Guy teaching at product school"/>
				<p>
					The Google Trends website ranks searches from a range of 0 to 100, from least popular to highest respectively. In the months September to October 2021 there was a noticeable spike in the	searches for interior design. The popularity number for the searches was 97.
				</p>
			</div>

			<div class="container">
				<h3>Industry/Target Market Feasibility</h3>
				<p>
					The company is centered around design, specifically interior design, and imports high quality designs from regional or international countries. Its main demographic are the many individuals who were located in St. Michael, St. James and Christ	Church from the Google Trends search above. These customers are	mainly going to require a fresh change to their living or work environment, or are in a new building space that needs re/furbishing.

				<h2>Business Model</h2>
				<img src="images/slidebean.jpg" />
				<p>
					Our	business falls under the standard business model; specifically, the traditional retailer business model as we are a business where its products are made by others and will be sold to consumers at a markup from the original price. Which also explains why this model best suits the company as the traditional retailer business model is a business model calling for a firm to sell its products or	services, made by others, directly to consumers at a markup from the original price. Can be sold online or offline. 
					(<cite>Barringer Bruce R; Ireland R Duane; Entrepreneurship -	Fifth	Edition</cite>) 
					To further explain why this model best suits us. We can be compared to the online retail clothing and shoe brand Zappos,which provides products from companies like Levi&rsquo;s and Adidas. Alike DANCS Designs, Zappos also falls under the category of the traditional retailer business model.

				<h2>Industry Analysis</h2>
				<img src="images/scott-graham.jpg" />
				<p>
					Our business can be said to fall under the fragmented industries category since there are multiple interior design businesses in	Barbados and there is no one company that holds a monopoly. It is a	realistic place for our business to enter due to the lack of interior design businesses in Barbados that offer as high a quality	or as high a level of unconventionality as we do. Though the interior design industry can be said to be a slow-growth industry, there is a meaningful difference between our products and our	competitors.
